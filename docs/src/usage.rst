How to Use DashLab
==================

Access & Restrictions
---------------------

DashLab is a personal project actively used and maintained by its author. While parts of the dashboard are open to all users, access to specific features is **restricted** to manage:

- **Resource costs** (hosting, databases, compute)
- **Security** of private or experimental tools
- **Personal projects** that are not intended for public use

This means you may not see all available modules or data when visiting the application.

Logging In
----------

To access more advanced or restricted sections of DashLab, you must log in:

1. Click on the **"Login"** button in the top navigation bar.
2. You will be redirected to a secure **AWS Cognito** login page.
3. There, you can either:
   - Log in with your existing credentials
   - **Create a new account**, which requires:
     - A valid email address
     - Confirmation through an email validation link

Approval Process
----------------

Once you've registered and verified your email:

- I (the maintainer) **automatically receive an email notification**
- I will manually review and **approve your access** as soon as possible
- Once approved, youâ€™ll be able to access the restricted content

Why This Process?
-----------------

This manual validation allows me to:

- Keep hosting and authentication costs reasonable (I cover them personally)
- Prevent abuse or spam accounts
- Maintain a good user experience and stability for all active users

Thank you for your understanding and interest in the project!
